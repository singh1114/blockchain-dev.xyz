Today we are going to talk about when it all started. October 31, 2008 was the first time when Sitoshi Nakamoto first published an [academic paper about Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

The idea behind the paper was to create a system where payments can happen between users without going through a financial institution. The idea was to create a peer-to-peer network where the transactions history relies on something called proof-of-work.

Also, it was not allowed to change anything for a transaction making it more secure.  

Soon after this paper was published in January 2009, the bitcoin network was brought online.

The original idea behind the bitcoin was to allow the users to make transactions, but soon people started realizing that the underlying concept of blockchain can be used at other places as well.

Another paper was released later under the name of Ethereum introducing the concept of smart contracts and many other things.
