Airdrop is a great way of rewarding your users for believing in your product.

In this post, we are going to discuss what they are in much more detail. By the end of the post, you will know what they are and how do companies use them. So, let's get started.

To understand why airdrops are done, we will have to understand how the market of cryptocurrencies works. Everything is fairly simple, it is based on demand and supply.

## What is crypto airdrop?

There are a limited number of tokens that are published for a given cryptocurrency. If you want to increase the price of your token, there should be a demand for that token.

The demand can be generated using multiple different ways, one of them is giving some tokens to the public for free.

These people will talk about your token which in return will generate more demand for it.

This process of giving out tokens is known as a crypto airdrop.

## How it is really done?

Of course, it is not feasible to give this token to each and every wallet owner on the globe so the token owner decides to which wallet addresses this token must be delivered.

There can many ways of choosing this. Someone can choose folks who have not sold some token in a long time. This is for the owner to decide to whom they want to give this token.

## When it is done?

This can be done when someone takes a hard fork of a cryptocurrency and they have to build the new chain, so they can airdrop the token to everyone who owns the old Cryptocurrency.

This can also be done when the token owner wants to reward its users.

Almost, all the time, companies will generate a lot of fuss about airdrop and try to get as many new onboard as possible. This does generate FOMO moments in the public and more and more users want to join.

As more and more people start to talk about it, more people will start buying it creating a never-ending loop of supply and demand leading the value of the coin to skyrocket. Then it doesn't matter if you have lost a few tokens in a giveaway at the end of the day the overall value of the token will increase.
